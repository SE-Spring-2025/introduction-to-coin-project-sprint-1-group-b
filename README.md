### Main Features/Functionality

Currently supports every coin in US circulation. The demo allows for the client to interact with the features we have written.

Also has a GUI interface that shows the counts for total quarters and overall coin totals.

### Setup

Clone the repository, and then run make compile from the terminal. Then you can run the tests, checkstyle, demo, etc.

### Usage instructions.

Once you've cloned the repository, run make compile, and then make demo. If you want to run the tests, run make test. **DO THIS FROM THE SOURCE DIRECTORY**

### Contribution guidelines.

Make sure your code is readable and follows the checkstyle standards. Run make check whenever you add new code and adjust as needed.

### Code structure

Each class has its own test class. Make sure that you test your code and make sure everything is functional before committing and opening a PR.
